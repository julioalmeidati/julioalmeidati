👋 Hi, I'm Julio Almeida(@julioalmeidati), 38 years old.

👀 I have like 20 years of professional experience, but I'm a rookie here. 
   
💪 I'm a Computer Science graduate, I have an MBA in Business Management, and I'm part of the dream team that won the Future Executive Leader 91 award, certified by 'Crescimentum' company. 
   
❤️ Oh, and I'm married to Natalia, but we still don't have mini-humans.
   
🚀 Right now, I'm chasing English fluency and doing a post-graduation in Cloud Computing by XP Educação, and the Full Cycle 3.0 certification, which is practically another post-graduation. 
  
🤘 I breathe technology every single day, no matter which one, as long as it solves business problems more easily and quickly.

And, of course, 

I rely on my superpower of  friendship,

where my friends and teams face the most hairy challenges with me, but they seem like a piece of cake when we're together 👊👊👊.
  
Give me a hand, leave a 🌟🌟🌟... that way, I'll be pumped to keep going and release the most diverse topics and, of course, learn from you every single day. 
  
You can count on me for whatever you need, bros!
