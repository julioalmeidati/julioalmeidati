👋 Hi, I'm Julio Almeida(@julioalmeidati). I'm 41 years old.

👀 I’ve got about 20 years of professional experience, but I’m still a rookie here. 
   
💪 I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and an MBA in Business Management, and I was part of the award-winning team recognized with the Future Executive Leader 91 award by Crescimentum. 
   
❤️ Oh, and I'm happily married to Natalia — no mini-humans yet!
   
🚀 I'm currently pursuing English fluency while continuously learning through Full Cycle (3.0 and 4.0), an e-learning platform that regularly releases updated content across both versions on cutting-edge software architecture and development practices to stay ahead of market trends. 
  
🤘 I live and breathe technology every day — any tool or approach that solves business problems more efficiently and effectively.

And, of course, I rely on my superpower: friendship.
My friends and teams tackle the toughest challenges alongside me — challenges that seem like a piece of cake when we're together. 👊👊👊.
  
Give me a hand — leave a 🌟🌟🌟!
That way, I'll stay pumped to keep sharing diverse topics and, of course, learning from you every single day.
  
You can count on me for whatever you need, folks!
Get in touch anytime.
